\section{Desired Solution}
Ideally, the objective is to create an approach which will inform its user of
what in the running applications is negatively affected by cache coherence,
exactly what part of the cache coherence is causing this interference, and what
exactly is its effect. All of this without requiring hardware modifications.

\begin{itemize}
\item Ensure the user understands the cache coherence mechanisms of its
architecture.

\item Does not require hardware modifications.
\end{itemize}
