\section{Conclusion}
This chapter concludes the context part of the thesis by clearly defining the
objective of this thesis and curtailing its target application.

The next part of the thesis presents a selection of the existing literature
relevant to this thesis. It starts with a chapter focused on benchmarking
(Chapter~\ref{cha:micro-benchs}), providing a description of approaches that can
be used to measure the performance of the architecture's cache coherence
mechanisms once the protocol has been identified.

Literature around the broader issue of using a multi-core processor's caches in
a critical real-time environment is then presented
(Chapter~\ref{cha:handling_it}). None of the existing solutions allow the use of
cache coherence within an aeronautical context, but there are ways to still
benefit from caches by adhering to restrictions on their use.

Lastly, the related works part of this thesis features a chapter on approaches
similar to that presented in this thesis for the use of formal methods to
analyze an architecture (Chapter~\ref{cha:analyzing_rel_work}). It shows that
the use of timed automata eases the creation of both readable and modular
models.
