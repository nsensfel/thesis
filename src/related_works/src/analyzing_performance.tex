\chapter{Analyzing Performance Through Formal Methods}
\label{cha:analyzing_rel_work}
The most common use of formal methods in relation to cache coherence is to
validate protocol correctness (i.e.~that a protocol verifies the properties set
in Section~\ref{sec:proper_cache_coherence_protocol}).  Indeed, the use of model
checking for that purpose is the source of many publications. For example,
\cite{conchon13jfla} describes a parameterized model checker by focusing on the
verification of a cache coherence protocol, by taking its description from yet
another paper using model checking to verify it (\cite{Baukus2002}) and thus
allowing a comparison between the approaches.

However, proving the correctness of a cache coherence protocol is not the
subject of this thesis. We assume the protocols to be correct, and are instead
interested by the impact the cache coherence has on the real-time properties
of the system. Thus, in chapter, we look at real-time systems using
formal methods to analyze the real-time properties of an architecture. As this
is a fairly restrictive criterion, the results include approaches meant for
single-core processors in addition to those for the more on-topic multi-cores.
