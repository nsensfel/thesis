This chapter presents the concept of timed automata, which is the formal model
used in this thesis, and an associated formal method: reachability analysis
through model checking. In the first section, the main concepts behind
classical automata are introduced, with some fairly common additions: the use
of variables, having conditions and actions in transitions, and
synchronization. A definition of the temporal logic operators used in this
thesis is also given in the classical automata section. Timed automata are
introduced in a second section. As this thesis does not dwell into the theory
of automata, but simply uses them as a modeling tool, many details (such as
their precise semantics, the language theory or the details of how model
checking is achieved) are omitted.  Indeed, the objective of the chapter is for
the reader to have an understanding of the models of cache coherence presented
in later chapters, as well as the operators being used to query on them. Since
the aforementioned details are not directly related to the work presented in
this thesis, they are considered to be outside of the scope of this chapter.
