\subsection{False Sharing}
\label{sec:false_sharing}
False sharing occurs when the memory used by two otherwise independent program
objects end up in the same cache line. As a result, any access performed on
either one of these objects leads to an access to at least part of the other
object's memory. When two caches each frequently access one of those two
objects, they impede each other by continuously having to re-take the
permissions from the other cache.
