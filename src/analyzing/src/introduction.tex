The previous chapter described a model of multi-core architecture with a focus
on cache coherence. This chapter explores the ways this model can be analyzed
through formal methods in order to expose and quantify the impact of cache
coherence interference. Part of the work presented in this chapter was
published in \cite{ecrts19}.
