\section{Split-Transaction Bus, case of the MSI Protocol}
\label{sec:split_msi}
Section~\ref{sec:intro_to_msi} provides an overview of the MSI protocol without
considerations for the possibility of interleaving or even asynchronous
communications. This section presents an MSI protocol featuring all of those.
This leads a large number of additional states and transitions, so instead of
using graphs to represent the automata, we use matrices (see
Figure~\ref{fig:msi_cc_table} for the cache controllers, and
Figure~\ref{fig:msi_mgr_table} for the coherence manager). The columns in
these matrices correspond to the events from Definition~\ref{def:event}. Bear
in mind that this corresponds to how the caches and the coherence manager act
for each memory element, according to the state currently assigned to that
state (first column). The \textbf{Own Query} column in the cache's
table corresponds to when it processes one of its own queries (from its incoming
query queue) for that memory element. In the coherence manager's table, the
behavior upon reception of a query may differ according to whether the emitter
is the owner (as defined by the \coherencemanagerownerfun{} function) or not.

\subsection{State Naming}
\label{sec:cache_state_naming}
Invalid (\texttt{I}), Shared (\texttt{S}), and Modified (\texttt{M}) are the
three stable states of the \texttt{MSI} protocol, the other states are
transient.

Reception of a request that requires use of the interconnect will usually lead
to a \texttt{XY\textsuperscript{BD}} transient state, which means that the
cache controller is handling a transition between the stable states \texttt{X}
and \texttt{Y}, with \textsuperscript{B} indicating that this transition
requires the acquisition of the interconnect and \textsuperscript{D} the
reception of a related data reply (regardless of whether it comes from an other
cache controller or the memory).

\texttt{XY\textsuperscript{D}} usually follows \texttt{XY\textsuperscript{BD}}
if the cache controller sees its own query before receiving a reply. If the
reply is seen first, then the memory element goes into the
\texttt{XY\textsuperscript{B}} state instead. While the former is more likely,
the latter may occur because, despite processing all queries in the same order,
not all cache controllers take the same time to do so.

It is also possible an external query to lead to a change of state, especially
when in the \texttt{XY\textsuperscript{D}} state. Indeed, at that point, the
system pretty much considers that the cache controller is in the \texttt{Y}
state, and thus has the responsibilities that the \texttt{Y} state would imply.
This makes it possible for a cache controller to see a query it needs to act
upon before being actually ready to do so (e.g.~observing a \texttt{GetM} query
while waiting for \texttt{data}). The states thus reached have either a
\texttt{XY\textsuperscript{D}V} pattern, with \texttt{V} being a stable state,
indicating that the external query would have required this memory element to be
assigned the \texttt{V} state if it were currently in the \texttt{Y} state.
Thus, this state is used to memorize that, after sending the data, the cache is
expected to perform the appropriate change of state. It is possible for
the \texttt{Y} state to also be susceptible to external queries. Thus, there
are also \texttt{XY\textsuperscript{D}YZ} states, indicating that the final
state is now \texttt{Z}.

%Figure~\ref{fig:msi_mgr_table} shows how the coherency manager keeps track of
%whether the RAM has the most up-to-date value for a memory element (state
%\texttt{I}) or if a cache controller does (state \texttt{M}). This is used to
%determine if the RAM should be the one to reply when either a \texttt{GetS} or a
%\texttt{GetM} query passes through the interconnect. The \texttt{I} state
%indicates that the RAM currently has the most up-to-date value. The
%\texttt{I\textsuperscript{D}} state indicates that the RAM should be the one to
%respond to queries, but it still hasn't received the latest value.  Unlike the
%cache controller, it will not switch to a dedicated state but instead force
%queries from the interconnect to stall until the problematic query can be
%fulfilled. \texttt{I\textsuperscript{B}} indicates that the RAM has received
%the latest value, but has not yet seen the query that led this data to be sent.

\begin{example}[Simple Read]
\label{ex:split_msi_simple_read}
In this example a single cache is moving from not having any access to a
memory element to having a read-only copy. This is one the simplest example of
transaction and is meant to show how messages are exchanged. This example is
illustrated as a sequence in Figure~\ref{fig:split_msi_simple_read}.

assumed to take place. To keep things simple, we only consider two cores and a
