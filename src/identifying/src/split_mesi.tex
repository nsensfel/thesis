Following the information available in documentation of the architecture
(\cite{T4240} and \cite{e6500}), the first step is to define an ambiguity-free
description of the MESI protocol (Figures~\ref{fig:mesi_cc_table} and
\ref{fig:mesi_cmgr_table}).  Introduced in
\cite{Papamarcos:1984:LCS:773453.808204}, the MESI protocol adds a fourth stable
state, \textit{Exclusive}, which indicates that not only does the cache
controller have read-only permissions, but also that no other cache currently
holds any permission to access the memory element. This allows the cache
controller to upgrade to read-and-write permissions without having to perform a
costly communication. Just as it is used to keep track of whether a cache holds
a read-and-write copy of a memory element in the MSI protocol, this definition
of the MESI protocol uses the coherence manager to detect when a cache can be
said to be the sole owner of a memory element.

This version of the MESI protocol uses three types of data replies:
\texttt{data}, \texttt{data-e}, and \texttt{no-data}. \texttt{data} indicates
that the value associated with the memory element is sent.  By sending a
\texttt{no-data} reply, cache controllers can indicate to the coherence manager
that the memory element has been discarded (its value is not part of the
reply). The coherence manager can send \texttt{data-e} replies, which are
equivalent to \texttt{data}, with the added information that the recipient is
its sole owner.

Here are some examples of remarkable behaviors exhibited by this definition of
the MESI protocol.

\begin{example}[\textbf{Reaching \texttt{E}}]
\label{ex:reaching_e}
To hold a memory element in the \texttt{E} state, a cache must be the only one
to have a copy of that memory element. The caches rely on the coherence manager
to know when it is the case. The coherence manager uses its \texttt{I} state to
mark memory elements that are sure not to be in any caches.  Thus, if no cache
controllers hold the memory element and the coherence manager is in \texttt{I},
whenever a core \texttt{loads} the data it becomes \texttt{E} in its cache,
receiving the \texttt{data} message leads it to the \texttt{E} state instead of
the \texttt{S} state.

It is important to notice that it is not easy for the coherence manager to detect whether a cache controller is the sole owner.
Indeed, the
coherence manager is not always able to know that all caches have evicted their
copy of a memory element: in Figure~\ref{fig:mesi_cc_table}, the cache
controller's table indicates that an eviction from \texttt{S} does not lead to
any message.
The only way for the coherence
manager to return to the \texttt{I} state is for a cache to evict its copy
of a memory element in either the \texttt{E} or \texttt{M} state without another
cache asking for a copy.
\end{example}

\begin{example}[\textbf{Sharing from \texttt{E}}]
\label{ex:sharing_from_e}
From the coherence manager's point of view, there is no difference between a
cache controller owning a memory element in the \texttt{E} state and one in the
\texttt{M} state. Thus, if there is a cache owning a copy of a memory element in
the \texttt{E} state, the coherence manager will assume that this cache may have
modified the value and that the main memory no longer holds the correct value.
As a result, the cache holding the \texttt{E}xclusive copy of the memory element
will transfer it to any other cache that asks for it. If this is caused by
another cache demanding a read-only copy (\texttt{GetS}), the coherence manager
will expect an update on the value of the memory element. This update can come
in two forms: either the cache that exclusively held the memory element made a
modification (in which case it would have moved to the \texttt{M}odified state)
and sends a \texttt{data} message, or it has not and it sends a \texttt{no-data} message.
\end{example}
